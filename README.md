# Flask-Projects
This repository contains the mini-projects that I made while learning the Flask framework. 

Each project contains a seperate README file describing the project, technology stack used in it, procedure to use it on your local machine and a screenshot of the working project.

Below is the list of the mini-projects:

- [Simple Calculator (Flask)](https://github.com/tanvi355/Flask-Projects/tree/main/Simple%20Calculator%20(Flask))
- [BMI Calculator (Flask)](https://github.com/tanvi355/Flask-Projects/tree/main/BMI%20Calculator%20(Flask))
